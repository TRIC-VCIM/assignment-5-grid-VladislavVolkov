        The band was formed in 1985 in Minsk, Belarus by two teenagers, Aleksandr "Shura" Uman and Egor "Lyova" Bortnik, who were amateur actors. Initially, the band's name was "Bratya po Oruzhiyu" (Brothers in Arms), which was formed in 1988, then "Bereg Istini" (Shore of Truth), which resulted in abbreviation BI-2. This word Lyova and Shura began to use as their scenic names, and Shura eventually changed his passport surname to Bi-II.
